# Snappy

Snappy is a web app for capturing automatic screenshots, inspired by [AutoScreenCap](https://autoscreencap.sourceforge.io/). You can select a window, screen, or browser tab, then start the capture to automatically save an image on a specified interval. It can be helpful for recording presentations, livestreams, or other similar use cases.

Snappy is still experimental and not fully stable/finished. Don't use it for anything important yet!
