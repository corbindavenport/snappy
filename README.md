# Snappy

Snappy is a web app for capturing automatic screenshots, inspired by [AutoScreenCap](https://autoscreencap.sourceforge.io/). You can select a window, screen, or browser tab, then start the capture to automatically save an image on a specified interval. It can be helpful for recording presentations, livestreams, or other similar use cases.

Snappy can be installed as a standalone application, and it works offline after it is loaded for the first time. In some browsers (such as Google Chrome), it can even capture background tabs, which are normally not accessible to screenshot tools.
